Welcome to my personal Python Bootcamp 3 repository — a space where I document my growth, struggles, breakthroughs, and learning progress as I explore the world of Python programming.

This repo isn't just a folder of code.
It is my learning journal — showing how I started, what I learned, and how far I’ve come.

Why I Created This Repository

I wanted a single place to store:

My lesson files

My coding practices

My hands-on exercises

My reflections on what I learned

Every folder represents a step forward in my understanding of Python.
Every file shows my effort, consistency, and curiosity.

📘 What You’ll Find Inside
📁 Lesson01 – Variables

My first step into Python!
I learned how to:

Create variables

Work with strings, numbers, booleans

Print meaningful sentences

Combine variables with text

This lesson built my foundation and boosted my confidence.

📁 Lesson02 – Data Types

I explored the different types of data Python uses, including:

Integers

Floats

Strings

Booleans

Lists

Tuples

Dictionaries

This helped me understand how Python stores and processes information.

📁 Lesson03 – String Manipulation

My favourite so far — I learned how to play with text!
I practised:

Formatting strings

Changing text to upper/lowercase

Counting characters

Slicing strings

This made me feel like I was really using Python, not just copying code.

🧠 Skills I Am Building Through This Bootcamp

Problem-solving with code

Writing clean, structured Python programs

Understanding how computers interpret instructions

Practising logical thinking

Learning Git & GitHub to track my progress

🚀 Why This Journey Matters to Me

I joined Python Bootcamp 3 because I wanted to grow as a lifelong learner.
Every line of code reminds me that I can still learn, explore, and challenge myself.

This repo will continue to evolve as I complete more lessons — and I can’t wait to see how much more I’ll achieve.

🤝 Acknowledgements

Special thanks to the instructors, mentors, and peers who guided me and created a supportive environment. Your encouragement keeps me moving forward.

💬 Final Thought

“Learning to code is not about perfection — it’s about progress.”
This repository is the story of my progress.
